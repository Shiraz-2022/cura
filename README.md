## The problem Cura solves
Chronic disease patients often face significant isolation, both emotionally and socially, which makes managing their condition more difficult. Many lack access to the right tools, support networks, or real-time insights into their health, leaving them feeling overwhelmed and disconnected. Traditional healthcare often focuses solely on treatment, neglecting the emotional and community aspects that are crucial for long-term well-being. Without proper support, patients can struggle with the daily challenges of managing their condition, leading to a decline in both physical and mental health. This lack of connection can also result in patients feeling like they are facing their health journey alone, making it even harder to maintain consistent self-care.

## Solution 
Our app offers a holistic solution for managing health and fostering community among chronic disease patients. It combines advanced health tracking features, such as real-time monitoring of nutrients like fats, proteins, carbs, and calories, and integrates seamlessly with smartwatches to gather vital metrics like heart rate and activity levels. Using AI-powered tools, the app provides image-based meal analysis, personalized diet plans, and fatigue prediction to empower users with actionable insights for healthier living. Beyond health management, the app builds a strong sense of community through global and regional groups where users can share experiences and support each other. Certified doctors are part of the community, offering guidance and answering questions, with plans for future one-on-one premium consultations.
