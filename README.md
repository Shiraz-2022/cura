## The problem Cura solves
Chronic disease patients often face significant isolation, both emotionally and socially, which makes managing their condition more difficult. Many lack access to the right tools, support networks, or real-time insights into their health, leaving them feeling overwhelmed and disconnected. Traditional healthcare often focuses solely on treatment, neglecting the emotional and community aspects that are crucial for long-term well-being. Without proper support, patients can struggle with the daily challenges of managing their condition, leading to a decline in both physical and mental health. This lack of connection can also result in patients feeling like they are facing their health journey alone, making it even harder to maintain consistent self-care.
